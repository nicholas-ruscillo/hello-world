# hello-world
Hello, I'm Nicholas Ruscillo and I've been a Solutions Architect and developer for over 25 years and more recently a CTO for a few start-ups, but have been leading and mentoring teams since the turn of the century. Surprising that it's only been now that I'm purposefully exposing myself to GITHUB in a more committed fashion; previously, I was managing code version using CVS and SVN which I found to be more than satisfactory - but, was interested to learn something new and see if there is some real benefit to moving to GITHUB. Starting now, I'm moving all my personal projects to GITHUB not only to have a central place to manage them, but to finally take these ideas off "the shelf" and action them. I think I'm going to enjoy this journey fully.
